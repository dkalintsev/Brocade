# What happened here?

I've moved things around:

- Templates that probably not worth keeping updated are now in `Old`
- `Configured-by-Puppet` has been promoted to the "currently recommended", as it's the most mature one.
- `Variants-and-Experimental/ASG-Puppet` is the current "state of the art"

I have not updated links in the README.md files in the `Old` directory, but I did for the `Configured-by-Puppet` and `Variants-and-Experimental/ASG-Puppet`. If you find any broken links, please kindly open a pull request or an issue.

Thank you :)
